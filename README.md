5. Doctors and Nurse cannot view billing accounts and information for patients.
6. Operators cannot access treatment information for any medical records of a patient.
7. Patient cannot change the bed for an active medical-record.
8. There are multiple payment methods such as Cash, Card, DD, Cheque.
